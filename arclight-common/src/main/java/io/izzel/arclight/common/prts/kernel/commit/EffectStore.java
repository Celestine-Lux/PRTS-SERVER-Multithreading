/** The typed effect records one commit line may point at: one immutable record per line that
 * declares one, bounded by the bytes and by the record count the store was built with, and never
 * evicted while a line still holds it.
 *
 * <p>Room is taken before anything is stored: a reservation charges the record it will hold and
 * freezes what it charged for, so a second record cannot be admitted into room the first one already
 * owns and a reservation cannot be filled with another record of the same length. A store built with
 * no room at all is refused rather than accepted as an empty and always-failing table.
 *
 * <p>Room alone may also be reserved, for a line whose outcome is not known until the side effect
 * has run: that reservation promises how many records and how many bytes the terminal record will
 * take, and the record is written inside that promise without asking for room again. A terminal
 * record that outgrows its promise is not written and not thrown away: it is counted as an
 * integrity fault and stays readable, and the store answers every later reservation with a refusal.
 *
 * <p>The store is in memory only: nothing here writes a file, so nothing here survives a restart.
 * A reference that cannot be resolved is answered as missing and never as an empty record. */
